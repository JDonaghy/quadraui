### Issues closed (9)

| # | Title | Path | Key deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MSV Debug-sidebar consumer pattern | B (PR #10) | 5 consumer-state round-trip tests, `examples/msv_multi_tree.rs`, CLAUDE.md Consumer patterns |
| 9 | MSV per-section scrollbar paint + track-page hit regions | A | `thumb_bounds` on `SectionLayout`, `fit_thumb`-based thumb position, 3 painted-indicator tests, natural-max clamp |
| 2 | MSV SC-panel consumer pattern | A | `examples/msv_sc_panel.rs`, 6 SC consumer-state tests (input keystroke, chevron toggle, collapse semantics) |
| 3 | GTK MSV paint↔click round-trip harness | A | `ImageSurface` + pixel-scan harness pattern, `gtk_msv_layout` rename, 4 GTK MSV tests |
| 4 | GTK TreeView paint↔click round-trip harness | A | `gtk_tree_layout` extracted, 4 GTK tree tests (mixed-decoration row pitch) |
| 5 | Promote 'harness is the gate' rule in CLAUDE.md | closed as superseded | Covered by Rule #6, Coverage taxonomy, Backend testability requirement |
| 12 | GTK twin of msv_multi_tree | A | `examples/gtk_multi_tree.rs`, proportional drag, active-section indicator |
| 13 | Backend trait coverage gap | B (PR #15) | 9 new trait methods (7 draw + msv_layout + tree_layout), `EditorPaintResult`, `Backend::line_height` |
| 14 | Shared AppLogic refactor | A | `examples/common/multi_tree.rs`, thin runner shells (~24 lines each), `EventControllerMotion` in `gtk::run` |

### CLAUDE.md sections added/updated

- **Cross-backend portability commitment** (new) — 6 sub-rules for "Windows/macOS for free" goal.
- **Primitive Authoring Rule #6** — test state-derived paint geometry.
- **Primitive Authoring Rule #7** — every primitive on Backend trait.
- **Coverage taxonomy** (new) — 3 bug classes, 3 test shapes, where they live.
- **Backend testability requirement** (new) — headless paint-to-memory per backend.
- **Consumer patterns: Debug-sidebar** — updated with scrollbar routing (TrackBefore/Thumb/TrackAfter), natural-max clamp, shared AppLogic pointer.
- **Consumer patterns: SC panel** (new) — aux=Input, collapsible sections, keystroke routing, collapsed semantics.
- **Development Workflow** (new) — branch-from-develop, Path A/B, smoke test, issue creation discipline.
- **Lessons captured** — shared AppLogic unit-mismatch bug, runner event-variant coverage gap.

### Test count progression

| Checkpoint | Lib tests |
|---|---|
| Session start | 307 |
| After #1 | 311 |
| After #9 | 311 |
| After #2 | 317 |
| After #3 | 338 |
| After #4 | 342 |
| Session end | 342 |

### Architectural decisions made

1. **Option (i) for scrollbar scroll_offset**: primitive introspects `SectionBody::Tree(t).scroll_offset` directly; no host-supplied measure threading.
2. **Backend::line_height()** on the trait: TUI returns 1.0 (cell), GTK returns Pango-resolved pixels. Portable sizing for shared AppLogic code.
3. **EditorPaintResult on the trait**: TUI populates cursor_position; GTK returns default. Trait shape is symmetric; data asymmetry is documented.
4. **Interior-pixel-scan** for GTK harness: skip 1px AA boundary on each edge; assert at interior pixels only. Documented in test comments.

### Open queue for next session

- #6 TUI + GTK rasterisers for MenuBar primitive
- #7 New SearchPanel primitive
- #8 Audit primitives without rasterisers (panel, progress, spinner, split, toast)
- #11 SC sidebar focus-restore after Esc (small polish)
