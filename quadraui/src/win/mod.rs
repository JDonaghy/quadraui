//! Win-GUI backend: Direct2D + DirectWrite rasterisers.
//!
//! #19 landed the Win32 window + Direct2D render-target bootstrap
//! (`run.rs`'s message loop, `backend.rs`'s `begin_frame`/`end_frame`)
//! — real WinAPI calls gated on `cfg(target_os = "windows")` so `cargo
//! check --features win` still type-checks `WinBackend`'s trait
//! completeness on Linux (see `backend.rs`'s module docs and `Cargo.toml`'s
//! `win` feature comment). Every `draw_*`/`*_layout` rasteriser is still
//! a `todo!()` stub — implement each one against Direct2D / DirectWrite
//! and the compiler will tell you when you're done.
//!
//! See `quadraui/docs/NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS.md` for pitfalls discovered
//! during earlier Win-GUI work. See the GTK backend (`quadraui/src/gtk/`)
//! as the reference implementation for a pixel-based backend.
