//! `Tooltip` primitive: a short text popup anchored to an element.
//! Used for hover-hint text (activity bar items, status segments,
//! truncated tab labels, LSP hover results that are small enough to
//! inline rather than a full docblock).
//!
//! A `Tooltip` is paired with an **anchor** rectangle — the element it
//! describes. The layout method picks a position (`placement`) near the
//! anchor that keeps the tooltip inside the viewport.
//!
//! # Backend contract
//!
//! **Declarative + placement.** Apps decide when a tooltip shows
//! (hover delay, keyboard focus, etc.) and pass the current anchor +
//! content. The primitive's `layout()` chooses x/y based on preferred
//! placement, adjusting if it would overflow the viewport. Backends
//! render a box with the content at the resolved position.

///
/// - When `height >= 3` (and `width >= 2`), [`crate::tui::draw_tooltip`]
///   strokes a full 4-sided box — one row each for the top and bottom
///   border — leaving only `height - 2` rows for content. GTK has always
///   stroked a full box the same way, but pays for it in sub-cell pixels
///   rather than whole rows, so it needs no equivalent padding.
/// - Below that (`height < 3`), TUI falls back to side-bars-only chrome
///   (`│` on the first/last column, no top/bottom rule) and all `height`
///   rows are usable for content.
///
/// **Callers that want *N* content lines visible on TUI once a bordered
/// box is drawn must pass `height >= N + 2`**, not `N`. This is a
/// behaviour change from before #542, when TUI drew no vertical chrome at
/// all and `height` meant exactly "content rows" on every backend; a
/// caller written against that older contract that still passes a bare
/// content-line count will silently lose its last two lines once its
