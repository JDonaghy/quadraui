//! The `Backend` trait — one implementation per platform target.
//!
//! Each backend (TUI, GTK, Win-GUI, and eventually macOS) implements this
//! trait. Apps write render code once, parameterised over `<B: Backend>`,
//! and every supported platform rasterises the same primitive descriptions
//! with platform-native drawing + input.
//!
//! See `quadraui/docs/BACKEND_TRAIT_PROPOSAL.md` §4 for design rationale.
